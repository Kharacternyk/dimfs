# Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="binary" label="Binary">

You can download a self-contained binary from
<https://github.com/Kharacternyk/klunok/releases/latest/download/klunok>.
You can also browse past releases at
<https://github.com/Kharacternyk/klunok/releases>.

Once downloaded, you can copy the binary to somewhere in you `$PATH`, for example:

```bash
sudo cp ~/Downloads/klunok /bin/
```

If you skip this step,
do not forget to specify the full path to the binary when invoking Klunok, for example
`~/Downloads/klunok`.

The binaries should work on all x86-64 Linux systems.
They will not work on architectures other than x86-64,
for example ARM on Raspberry Pi or 32-bit x86.
Please use alternative installation methods for other architectures.
