# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Depending on the severity of a vulnerability,
older minor versions may also be patched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities to nazar@vinnich.uk.
If you want to use a channel that is more secure than email,
express this intetion through email without disclosing the vulnerability,
and we will setup an alternative communication channel, e.g., Signal.

## Recognition

You will be credited for the vulnerability at klunok.org if you give permission.
Also, a modest (two-figure) bounty may be offered.
